#All hosts will be part of group leerlingen.

#Problem here is that IPs are volatile, they will change. Few solutions are:
#   -1. Put all IPs that DHCP can give below (hahaha)
#   -2. Give FIXED IP to my PCs with DHCP and MAC address (like teacher showed us)
#   -3. Use hostnames (how it works? not enough info YET)
