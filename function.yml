#EXPLANATION ON HOW TO PLAY THIS PLAYBOOK.
# 1. My objectif was to put everything in one playbook. And so to be able to only execute _certain_ tasks of the playbook but not everything, I used tags
# 2. As you can see below, some individual tasks have tags. You can add them, alter them easily. See the playbook, the tags are under 'name'.

#Execute a task:
#If you want to only execute the task for installing webserver then you use this command:
#COMMAND:  ansible-playbook --tags web function.yml
#Why ? Well, because there is the tag web to 'install webserver' task. There is also apache2 tag. Choose which tag you want to use, it doesn't matter

#To see lists of tags: 
#COMMAND: --ansible-playbook --list-tags function.yml

#I hope it helped ! PS: Issam :))

#basic tag: nmap, vim.
